      <h3>Terms of Service</h3>

      These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the https://manufacturingexchange.bennit.ai/ website (the “Website”) and the Bennit manufacturing Exchange, mobile applications and Services (collectively, the “Services”). You agree that by visiting the Services or by registering or using the Services, you are entering a legally binding agreement with Bennit, Inc., located at 8920 Fairmount Road
      Novelty, OH 44072 (“Bennit”) based on the Terms, the Privacy Policy and any applicable Community Guidelines, which are hereby incorporated by reference (collectively referred to as the “Agreement”). Your access to and use of the Services are conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with the Agreement. By accessing or using the Services you agree to be bound by the Agreement.

      <h4>1. Bennit as a Platform Provider</h4>
      Bennit operates as a marketplace connecting skilled consultants, engineers or other industry professionals (“Solution Providers’) with manufacturing companies in need of services (“Manufacturers”). Bennit is not a party to any employment agreement or contract that results from a connection made on or through the Services (“Solution Agreement”). The parties to any Solution Agreement are solely responsible for verifying that the Solution Agreement is executed and performed in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, including without limitation, employment laws, citizenship requirements, safety laws and tax laws. You expressly agree that Bennit has no obligations under any Solution Agreement and shall not be included as a party in any dispute related to a Solution Agreement.

      Bennit makes no representations or endorsements regarding any user, Solution Provider, Manufacturer, service request, or job opportunity posted on or through the Services. Bennit expressly disclaims any liability, including personal injury or death, that results from any job opportunity posted on the Services. Solution Providers may not use the Services or any connections they make through the Services to disclose any trade secret or other confidential information that they are contractually obligated to keep secure. Solution Providers and Manufacturers may only enter into Solution Agreements that they are not contractually barred from entering by any employment, non-compete or other contractual obligation. Solution Providers and Manufacturers shall be required to indemnify Bennit as provided in Section 9d of this Agreement in the event Bennit gets named as a party in any suit related to Solution Agreements, including without limitation, any allegation that entering into or the performance of a Solution Agreement breaches any third party contractual agreement.

      You are solely responsible for your use of the Services and for any consequences thereof. Bennit will not be liable for any damages or losses that occur as a result of your use of the Services. In the event you reveal confidential or other trade secret information pursuant to a Solution Agreement, we recommend you enter into a Non-Disclosure Agreement prior to disclosing any such information. Bennit will not be liable for any confidential or trade secret information that becomes disclosed related to your use of the Services.

      <h4>2. Basic Terms </h4>
      You are responsible for your use of the Services and for any consequences thereof. You may use the Services only if you can form a binding contract with Bennit and are not a person barred from accessing the Services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. If you are using the Services on behalf of a business or organization, you are expressly representing that you have the full right and authority to use the Services and to take any actions on or related to the Services. If you are under 18 years of age you may not use or access the Services for any reason. You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations.

      The Services are always evolving and the form and nature of the Services may change from time to time without prior notice to you. In addition, Bennit may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to Users generally and may not be able to provide you with prior notice. We also retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time without prior notice to you.

      The Services may include advertisements, which may be targeted to the content or information on the Services, queries made through the Services, or other information. The types and extent of advertising on the Services are subject to change. In consideration for Bennit granting you access to and use of the Services, you agree that Bennit, third party providers and partners may place such advertising on the Services or in connection with the display of content or information from the Services whether submitted by you or others.

      <h4>3. Privacy</h4>
      Any information that you provide to Bennit is subject to our Privacy Policy, which governs our collection and use of your information. You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information, including the transfer of this information to the United States and/or other countries for storage, processing and use by Bennit. As part of providing you the Services, we may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your Bennit account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving.

      <h4>4. Passwords</h4>
      You are responsible for safeguarding the password or credentials that you use to access the Services and for any activities or actions under your account. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account and with other accounts that you may connect to your Bennit account. Bennit cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements. You agree to notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.

      You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity or a name or trademark that is subject to any rights of another person without appropriate authorization. You may not use as a username any name that is offensive, vulgar or obscene.

      <h4>5. Content on the Services</h4>

Any use or reliance on any information you obtained through the Services is at your own risk. You understand that by using the Services, you may be exposed to content that might be offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate, or in some cases, postings that have been mislabeled or are otherwise deceptive. Under no circumstances will Bennit be liable in any way for any content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Services or broadcast elsewhere.
      You retain all ownership rights in the Content you upload to the Services (“User Content”).

We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address associated with your account or through the Services the next time you attempt to access your account.

Each of the subsections below only applies up to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the contents of this section may not apply to you.

      <h5>C. Limitation of Liability</h5>

      THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE BENNIT ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

      <h5>D. Indemnification</h5>
      To the extent not prohibited by law, you expressly agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Bennit Entities from and against any and all liabilities, expenses, damages and costs, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, related to all third party claims, charges and investigations related to (1) your failure to comply with the Terms; (2) your interactions with any other Bennit user or reliance on any information you view on the Services; (3) any injury, harm damage or loss that falls to you or a third-party related to a Solution Agreement; (4) your User Content, including without limitation, any claim by a third party or investigation by the government or government agency that your information is incorrect, misleading, fraudulent or otherwise inaccurate; (5) any unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets or breaches of employment, non-compete or other contractual obligations; and (6) any activity in which you engage on or through the Services.

      The failure of Bennit to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.

      <h4>A. Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</h4>

You agree that you may only bring claims against Bennit related to your use of the Services on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding.

      <h4>B. Entire Agreement</h4>
      These Terms, our Privacy Policy and any applicable Community Guidelines are the entire and exclusive agreement between Bennit and you regarding the Services (excluding any service for which you have a separate agreement with Bennit that is explicitly in addition or in place of these Terms), and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between Bennit and you regarding the Services.
